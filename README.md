## Rationale for MeFirstApp

Our team was interested in helping encourage users to recycle and came up with an idea of helping to educate them through our application.  
MeFirstApp is a game where users are provided with 12 pictures of items to be disposed, and users are supposed to decide whether they are recyclable or not.  
For added difficulty, we have also implemented a 30 second timer for the game to reduce the amount of time which users had for thinking, making their decisions increasingly intuitive.  
Upon completion of the game or the timer running out, users will be presented with their score and an option to play the game again.  
Ultimately, the goal of MeFirstApp is to allow users to be able to perfectly differentiate recyclables from general trash (that is to say, obtain full marks) within 30 seconds.  
With this added intuition, we hope that users are able to realize that their trash is recyclable before it leaves their hands and end up in a general waste bin.

## Scalability

MeFirstApp is highly scalable and easy to improve on.  
Further features could include:

- Randomizing of pictures so that users are not able to complete the game with muscle memory
- Adding more pictures of more types of rubbish, and increasing the timer accordingly
- Integration with a map of recycling bins available around them to increase recycling convenience
